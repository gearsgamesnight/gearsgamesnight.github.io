            <p>Game 1 - Pipes <br>
		1. Refrain from utilizing your pipe until successfully "tagging" (making contact with the pipe) against the opponent's spawn back wall. <br> 
		2. Upon successful tagging, you are granted weapons freedom, allowing you to engage and attack your opponent <br> 
		3. In the event of being eliminated before completing the tagging process and subsequently respawning, you regain immediate weapons freedom.

            <p>Game 3 - Olympics <br>
		1. All participants must gather on the middle bridge. <br>
		2. With closed eyes, everyone spins around, and after a brief pause, each player halts. The individual facing closest to the Market area (where the boltok is usually located) assumes the role of the Rules Setter. <br>
		3. The Rules Setter designates all other players as Runners and positions them at the low side of one of the side bridges. <br>
		4. The Rules Setter establishes a specific rule that the Runners must adhere to during the game. <br>
		5. Initiating the match with a sniper shot, the Rules Setter prompts the Runners to navigate a circular route around the high side, down to the lower side across the opposite bridge, and back to the starting point. Simultaneously, Runners must follow the rule set by the Rules Setter. <br>
		6. Upon reaching the Market, Runners are obligated to collect apples from at least one of the available apple stores, though obtaining apples from multiple carts is encouraged. <br>
		7. While the Runners are in motion, the Rules Setter, stationed on the central bridge, attempts headshots. If a player is successfully headshot, they join the Rules Setter for subsequent rounds and create their own rules. <br> </p>
